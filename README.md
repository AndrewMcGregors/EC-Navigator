#	EC Navigator
<p>
EC Navigator is an Embedded Controller viewer and hardware resource monitoring.<br> 
It allows to explore the EC of (old) PC and retrieve useful informations such as temperatures, fan speeds, batteries charges and so on.<br>
Some laptop models configurations are already included but it is possible to add custom configurations for unsupported machine.<br>
It is easy to compile with the mingwu gcc compiler. 
Just download the program and unpack it in your favourite folder (es: c:\myapps), then download the compiler and unpack it in the same folder (es: c:\myapps).
Finally, use the batch file you can find in the source folder (es: c:\myapps\ECNavigator\src) to create your own compilation.<br> 
In order to run EC Navigator is necessary to have administrator rights which are required to load the drivers it uses. It works fine under Windows XP, Vista .. Windows 10. <br>
I hope you enjoy it.
